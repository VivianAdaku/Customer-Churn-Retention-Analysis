**Customer Churn Analysis — Report/Summary**

Executive Context

Customer churn directly impacts recurring revenue and growth. This analysis was conducted to identify who is leaving, why they are leaving, 
and where the business should intervene to reduce future churn.


**Headline Results**
	•	Total Customers: 7,043
	•	Customers Churned: 1,869
	•	Overall Churn Rate: 26.5%
	•	Estimated Revenue Lost: $2.86M

**Key takeaway:**
More than 1 in 4 customers leave, indicating a material retention risk.

**Who Is Most Likely to Churn**

The following customer groups show significantly higher churn risk:
	•	**Senior citizens**
Higher sensitivity to pricing and service issues.
	•	**Customers without partners or dependent**
Fewer switching barriers and lower commitment.
	•	**Customers in their first 12 months**
Churn is highest early in the customer lifecycle, indicating onboarding and expectation gaps.


**Behavioral Drivers of Churn**

Churn is driven by how customers pay, what they pay, and how committed they are:
	•	**High monthly charges**
Customers paying above-average prices churn more, especially early in their tenure.
	•	**Month-to-month contracts**
These customers churn at much higher rates than those on 1- or 2-year contracts.
	•	**Fiber optic internet users**
Higher expectations combined with higher pricing increase dissatisfaction risk.
	•	**Lack of tech support**
Customers without access to support churn more frequently.
	•	**Payment method matters**
Customers paying via electronic check churn the most, followed by mailed checks.

**What the Tenure vs Pricing Analysis Reveals**

A detailed comparison of customer tenure and monthly charges shows that:
	•	Highest churn risk occurs among customers who:
	•	Pay higher-than-average monthly charges and
	•	Have short tenure or flexible contracts
	•	High-paying customers with long tenure and long-term contracts are stable, indicating that price alone does not cause churn. 
  Contract commitment and customer maturity significantly reduce risk.


**Business Implications**
	•	Churn is predictable and preventable
	•	Early-stage customers are the most vulnerable
	•	Pricing risk is amplified without contract commitment or support
	•	Retention efforts should be targeted, not blanket


**Recommended Actions**
	1.	Strengthen early customer onboarding
	•	Focus on the first 90–180 days
	2.	Incentivize long-term contracts
	•	Convert month-to-month customers to annual plans
	3.	Target high-charge, low-tenure customers
	•	Proactive offers or plan reviews
	4.	Expand access to tech support
	•	Especially for fiber optic users
	5.	Encourage automated and card-based payments
	•	Reduce friction linked to manual payment methods

**Conclusion**

Churn is driven by a combination of pricing, tenure, contract flexibility, and support access.
By intervening early, reinforcing commitment, and aligning pricing with perceived value, the business can materially reduce churn and protect long-term revenue.
